							In the spring semester of 2017, I was a Software Developer Intern at Binghamton University Libraries.  The goal of our team during the spring semester was to allow non-programmers to create custom books for the Augmented Reality Magic Book as all the previous books had to be hard coded.  <A href="https://github.com/ARMagicBook/BookBuilder">While one group worked on a book builder program so that anyone can create a book</A>, my job was devlop code to read in the created XML document into the objects. I also created the objects like Book, Page, etc.  I participated in weekly scrum meetings and gave some input on the design process.  This project is done in C# and we used GitLab to organize and track our code.

								In April of 2017, I was given the opportunity in my Mobile Game Development course to do a project of whatever I wanted.  What I decided to do was create an application for my phone called Avalanche.  Avalanche was originally a game created for the TI series of calculators.  Mt best friend and I would competed in the eighth grade to see who would get the highest score.  When I was thinking about what project I wanted to do, I realized that Avalanche was not recreated for Android devices.  So I set out to change that.
							</p>
							<p>
								During this project, I used Android Studio to code this application.  I created a home screen, kept track of the high score, and made sure the physics worked during this program.  After the semester ended, I added a difficulty modifier and kept track of the twenty highest scores.
